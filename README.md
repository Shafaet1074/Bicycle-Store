## Description

Bi-Cycle Store B4A2V4 is a full-stack Express application developed with TypeScript, integrated with MongoDB and Mongoose to manage a bicycle store's inventory and order system. It allows users to manage products (bicycles), handle orders, and track revenue from all orders placed.

## Features

### Product Management
- **Create a Bicycle:** Add a new bicycle to the store's inventory with details like name, brand, price, type, description, quantity, and stock status.
- **Get All Bicycles:** Retrieve a list of all bicycles in the store with search capabilities based on name, brand, or type.
- **Get Specific Bicycle:** View detailed information for a specific bicycle using its unique ID.
- **Update a Bicycle:** Modify the details of an existing bicycle, such as price and quantity.
- **Delete a Bicycle:** Remove a bicycle from the store's inventory.

### Order Management
- **Place an Order:** Customers can place an order for a bicycle, specifying quantity and email. The system will update the stock accordingly.
